### Project developed by Kevin Shi and Hrithik Choudhary

To make the pretrained model work, you need to execute the following in terminal (IDE terminal is probably easier):
pip install -U sentence-transformers

We chose to develop the model from scratch just in case we were not supposed to use pre-built chatbot frameworks.

main.py - Creates the knowledge base.
chatbot.py - Enables the chatbot.
