dowel,"To make a dowel, a piece of wood is split or whittled to a size slightly bigger than desired and then driven through the hole in the dowel plate."
dowel,"Some dowel plates solve the problem by cutting a groove in the side of the dowel as it is forced through; this is done by a groove screw, a pointed screw intruding from the side into the dowel cutting opening."
dowel,"Typically, the mechanism is open-ended, with material guides at the machine's entry and exit to enable fabrication of continuous dowel rods of unlimited length."
dowel,"If no provision is made to relieve the hydraulic pressure of air and glue, hammering the dowel home or clamping the joint can split the wood."
dowel,"When dowels are glued into blind holes, a very common case in dowel-based joinery, there must be a path for air and excess glue to escape when the dowel is pressed into place."

dunk,"In 2004, as a high school senior, Candace Parker was invited to participate in the McDonald's All-American Game and accompanying festivities where she competed in and won the slam dunk contest."

jump,"Exploiting the fact that the opposing point guard is often an undersized player with limited strength, several modern point guards have developed games close to the basket that include being able to utilize the drop step, spin move, and fade away jump shot."
jump,"Variations on the simple jump shot include the ""turnaround jumper"" (facing away from the basket, then jumping and spinning towards it, shooting the ball in mid-air); the ""fadeaway"" (jumping away from the basket to create space); and the ""leaning jumper"" (jumping towards the basket to move away from a trailing defender)."
jump,"In 1981, the NCAA adopted the alternating possession system for all jump ball situations except the beginning of the game, and in 2003, FIBA adopted a similar rule, except for the start of the third period and overtime."
jump,"In the NCAA, once the first possession has been established from the opening tip, no further jump balls occur except to begin an overtime period."
jump,"When a dispute over ball possession arises, the jump ball is used in the NBA and WNBA."
jump,"For example, if the stretch four pops to the perimeter after setting a screen, then their defender will most likely not have enough time to closeout and contest the potential open jump shot if the defender executes drop coverage."
jump,"Composite diagram of a basketball court with FIBA (top half only), NBA (both halves), and NCAA (men's & women's – bottom half only) markings The backboard and basket The only two players permitted to enter this area prior to the tipoff are the players contesting the jump ball (usually but not always centers)."
jump,Hank Luisetti is credited with popularizing the jump shot.
jump,"The alternating possession rule is used to start all overtime periods under international rules for full-court basketball,[10] while a jump ball is used under high school and NCAA rules, with the arrow reset based on the results of the jump ball to start each overtime."
jump,"Although early critics thought the leap might lead to indecision in the air, the jump shot replaced the earlier, less quickly released set shot, and eventually transformed the game because it is the easiest shot to make from a distance and more difficult for a defender to block."
jump,"However, John Christgau, in The Origins of the Jump Shot, makes a strong case that Ken Sailors did so in May 1934."
jump,"The jump ball was still used to start the game and every period, and to restart the game after a held ball."
jump,"Some are very accurate shooters, and some prefer to initiate physical contact with opposing players, such as Kevin Durant while others are primarily slashers who also possess jump shots."
jump,"The center jump ball that was used to restart a game after every successful field goal was eliminated in 1938, in favor of the ball being given to the non-scoring team from behind the end line where the goal was scored, in order to make play more continuous."
jump,"There is no violation during the jump ball, a throw-in or a free throw."
jump,Debate still continues as to who invented the jump shot.
jump,"From 1931, if a closely guarded player withheld the ball from play for five seconds, play was stopped and resumed with a jump ball; such a situation has since become a violation by the ball-carrier."
jump,"Also following each ""goal"", a jump ball was taken in the middle of the court."
jump,"Players are, however, permitted to jump while attempting the free throw, provided they do not leave the designated area at any point."
jump,"The other layup is the overhand shot, similar to a jump shot but from a considerably close range."
jump,The motion and one-handed reach distinguish it from a jump shot.
jump,The team that did not get first possession in the game gets first possession in overtime (as jump balls are not used in 3x3).
jump,The two most common shots that use the above described setup are the set shot and the jump shot.
jump,"After the 1946 edition saw the first jump shot performed by Italian player Giuseppe Stefanini, the following edition would see the Soviet Union compete in their first edition in the 1947 edition and would see the Soviets win the first of eleven out of the next thirteen European championships."
jump,"The Women's National Basketball Association, which use a quarter-possession rule to start periods after the opening jump, also use a jump ball."
jump,"On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard."
jump,"However, he also took his fair share of mid-range jump shots and three-pointers."
jump,"If the shooting guard focuses more on taking perimeter jump shots, especially three-pointers, by the use of basketball screens such as down screens, and without much dribbling involved, then the shooting guard is typically known as a catch-and-shoot type of player."
jump,"Other people that Christgau credits with the jump shot are Glen ""Glenn"" Roberts, Myer ""Whitey"" Skoog, John ""Mouse"" Gonzales, Bud Palmer, Davage ""Dave"" Minor, “Jumping” Joe Fulks, Johnny Adams, and Belus Smawley."
jump,"However, the NBA stopped using the jump ball to start the second through fourth quarters in 1975, instead using a quarter-possession system where the loser of the jump ball takes the ball from the other end to start the second and third periods, while the winner of that jump ball takes the ball to start the fourth period from the other end of the court."
jump,"For a jump shot, the throw is taken in mid-air with the ball being released near the top of the jump."
jump,"The power forward is often the team's most powerful and dependable scorer, being able to score close to the basket while also being able to shoot mid-range jump shots from 10 – 15 feet from the basket."
jump,"The hang time is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping, either to make a slam dunk, layup or jump shot."
jump,"Hinkle was instrumental in ending the rule providing for a jump ball after every basket, and in the introduction of the three-second rule."
jump,"Willis Reed won two championships with the New York Knicks in 1970 and 1973, teamed with point guard Walt Frazier; although undersized for the center position at 6'9"", he had the strength to play inside, was a highly skilled jump shooter and was effective at setting picks, a key element in the Knicks motion-oriented offense."
jump,"Generally, you fake the defender into defending a regular layup on the near side and then jump to the far side of the basket before shooting."
jump,"Still, a first-rate point guard should also have a reasonably effective jump shot."
jump,"In basketball (and derivatives like netball), a player may attempt to score a basket by leaping straight into the air, the elbow of the shooting hand cocked, ball in hand above the head, and lancing the ball in a high arc towards the basket for a jump shot (colloquially, a jumper)."
jump,Skilled low post players can score many points per game without ever taking a jump shot.
jump,"However, a good jump shot and the ability to score off a drive to the basket are still valuable skills."

defender,"A block is performed when, after a shot is attempted, a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball."
defender,"For example, if the stretch four pops to the perimeter after setting a screen, then their defender will most likely not have enough time to closeout and contest the potential open jump shot if the defender executes drop coverage."
defender,"Although early critics thought the leap might lead to indecision in the air, the jump shot replaced the earlier, less quickly released set shot, and eventually transformed the game because it is the easiest shot to make from a distance and more difficult for a defender to block."

fouls,"In FIBA and NCAA women's basketball, the fouled player also shoots two free throws starting with the opponent's fifth foul in a period, considering that team fouls accrue from the fourth period on, as all overtimes are extensions of it for purposes of accrued team fouls."

fouls,"These fouls are assessed for excessive time-outs, defensive three seconds, scratched player dressing and playing, a player foul penalty situation, shattering backboards, or delay of game."
fouls,"The number of fouls that triggers a penalty is higher in college men's basketball because the game is divided into two 20-minute halves, as opposed to quarters of 12 minutes in the NBA or 10 minutes in the WNBA, college women's basketball, or FIBA play (note that the college women's game was played in 20-minute halves before 2015–16)."
fouls,"This allows a strategy where a team intentionally fouls this player, hoping that they will miss one or both shots and the defending team will re-gain possession of the ball."
fouls,"Also, in the 2022 season, more rules are to be implemented on the number of flagrant fouls to eventually lead to an overall cleaner game."

fouls,A team may make a certain number of non-shooting fouls per period before the opposing team is awarded free throws.
fouls,"The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and referees."
fouls,"However, in leagues that play 48-minute games such as the NBA, and in some leagues such as the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), players are allowed six personal fouls before being disqualified, and technical fouls assessed against them do not count toward this total."
fouls,Technical fouls assessed for a player foul penalty situation caused by an offensive foul still result in one free throw.

fouls,Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick.
fouls,"In FIBA, (W)NBA and NCAA women's play, the limit is four fouls per quarter; in the NBA, starting with the fifth foul (fourth in overtime), or the second in the final 2 minutes if the team has less than 5 fouls (4 in OT), the opposing team gets two free throws."
fouls,"The difference in this case was that Donaghy sought to affect the outcome of over-under bets by changing calls so that both teams would score more than predicted, thus seeking to give the impression that at worst that he was merely strictly calling fouls as opposed to being outright biased."

fouls,An official who spots multiple fouls will throw their hat as a secondary signal.
fouls,"By 1979, the rule had been extended to the penalty situation for flagrant fouls, fouls made in the act of shooting (resulting in a miss), and fouls due to the swinging of the elbows."
fouls,"This limit became four fouls in 1911 and five fouls in 1945, still the case in most forms of basketball where the normal length of the game (before any overtime periods) is 40 minutes."
fouls,Blocking fouls are issued when a defensive player interferes with the path of the offensive player in the shooting motion.
fouls,"A common thread among small forwards is an ability to ""get to the line"" and draw fouls by aggressively attempting (posting-up) plays, lay-ups, or slam dunks."
fouls,1 Penalty applies to fouls in excess of four in a regulation period or in excess of three in an overtime period.
fouls,The number of team fouls allotted is also different.
fouls,"Under NCAA rules, technical fouls are divided into ""Class A"" (violent or serious unsportsmanlike conduct) and ""Class B"" (less egregious violations such as hanging on the rim or delay of game)."
fouls,Penalties for unsportsmanlike technical fouls are even higher for playoff games.
fouls,"Had technical fouls been formally assessed, the result would likely have been the ejection of both teams' entire squads (except for Pistons player Tayshaun Prince, who was the only player from either team to remain on the bench for the entire incident)."
fouls,"It is therefore common for a losing team to deliberately single out its opponent's poor free-throw shooters, regardless of their dominance in other aspects of the game (as in the cases of Ben Wallace and Shaquille O'Neal), as the targets of deliberate fouls until the two-minute mark, after which the losing team plays intense defense for the rest of the game; this strategy is known as the ""Hack-a-Shaq""."
fouls,One of the most famous technical fouls ever assessed was called on Chris Webber of the University of Michigan late in the 1993 NCAA championship game.
