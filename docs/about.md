## About Me

I am a senior CS undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am part of the Collegium V honors program and the CS^2 honors program. I am very interested
in machine learning and natural language processing. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with friends, reading, rock climbing, exercising, and playing video games.
